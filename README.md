This VBA macro in Outlook successfully imports .eml files exported from Thunderbird into a folder tree on disk,
into an Outlook folder tree in a nominated .PST having folder names replicated from the folder tree on disk.

The .eml email files on disk are moved to a "DONE" folder tree on disk on the fly, making it restartable should something go astray.

It's the only thing I have ever seen which does this with a folder tree of .eml files.
